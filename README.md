A small Yahtzee type application that is only 30kb!  This game was created by SFR, following the Puppy Linux lightweight and functional philosophy.

The game is written in bash using gtkdialog.  Therefore, it is possible to port to operating systems other than Linux.

## Requirements
* bash
* gtkdialog >=0.8.3

# Documentation
## Installation
Copy files under the /usr directory to the respective folder on your system.  However, Yahtzeez can be run by just executing the /usr/bin/yahtzeez script.

## Homepage
The homepage is a Puppy Linux forum [post](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=950138#950138) by SFR

## Rules
Yahtzee game rules from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee#Rules)
